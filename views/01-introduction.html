What is DOM
- The DOM (Document Object Model) in JavaScript is a programming interface that represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree of objects. It allows scripts to dynamically access, manipulate, and update the content, structure, and styles of a webpage.

Key Points:
1. Tree Structure: The DOM organizes elements (e.g., <html>, <body>, <p>) as nodes in a tree, where the document object is the root.
2. Interaction: JavaScript can use the DOM to add, remove, or modify elements, attributes, and text (e.g., document.getElementById(), querySelector(), appendChild()).
3. Event Handling: It enables responding to user actions like clicks or key presses (e.g., addEventListener()).
4. Cross-Language: While commonly used with JavaScript, the DOM is language-agnostic and defined by W3C standards.


In short, the DOM acts as a bridge between your HTML document and JavaScript, making webpages interactive and dynamic.
